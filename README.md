# War - Personal Project by Carl Fredrick
## About the project
This project is a very small and basic side project I created to test my JavaScript/HTML/CSS abilities. I started this project in May 2021 and spent the weekend trying to bring it to life. As my responsibilities grew and my available free time shrank, I found myself losing interest in the project and was never really able to finish it. I have made it a goal to try and work on it every now and then, allowing me to someday say I've fully finished a side project.

## Rules & how to play
As of the current version, all you can really do is click a button a bunch of times and watch as either you or your opponent accrue more cards. Hopefully in future versions I can make the experience at least a bit more interactive and fun!

There are many versions of the card game [*War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)). While some of these versions change many aspects of the game, the overall goal is *usually* the same throughout: **win all of the cards.**

First, the deck is shuffled and distributed evenly to both players (each gets 26 cards to start). Then, both players place the top card from their deck. Their decks are always face-down, so they will not be able to see which card they are going to place until they have already done so. Whoever has the highest card wins both of the cards, and the next round commences. This process is repeated until one player has all 52 cards.

If both players place the same card (two Kings or two 5's for example), a **war** commences, where both players each place two cards face-down, and finally another card on top face-up. Whoever has the highest card from this exchange wins all cards placed during the war.

In this version, suit and color do not matter.
Pretty easy, right?

## Plans for the future
Currently, the project is very basic and therefore lacking in many departments. Here's a quick list of things I wish to add to this project in the future:

- Online multiplayer
- Improved visuals (actual card art, animations, UI, etc.)
- More interactivity (moving cards around the play area rather than just clicking a button, for instance)
- Other versions of War like Tod und Leben?
- Sound effects
